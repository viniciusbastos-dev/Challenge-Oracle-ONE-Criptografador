# Text Cryptographer - Oracle One Challenge by Alura

This project consists of a simple and responsive website developed based on the Figma design provided by Alura. The goal is to convert texts using a specific encryption method where certain vowels are replaced by keywords.

## Features

The text cryptographer performs the following substitutions:

- The letter "a" is converted to "ai."
- The letter "e" is converted to "enter."
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes."
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober."
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat."

## Usage

1. Access the cryptographer website.
2. Enter the text you wish to encrypt in the provided text box.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to view the text converted according to the defined substitutions.
4. The encrypted text will be displayed in the designated area or copied to the clipboard, depending on the implementation.
